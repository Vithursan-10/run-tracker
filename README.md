🏃 Run Tracker App
📌 Overview

The Run Tracker App is a mobile-friendly running tracker built with React.js (frontend) and Spring Boot (backend). It allows users to track running distance, calculate pace, set target paces, and visualize performance with charts.

I created this project after noticing limitations in existing running apps, such as the fact that you can't have a target pace that you can compare to and not having a way to know your pace without having to constantly check my phone, which breaks my flow during running.

🚀 Features

Real-time GPS Tracking using the Geolocation API

Pace Calculation with color-coded feedback vs. target pace

Audio feedback of pace as well as comparison to target pace every minute

Charts & Visualization of distance, pace, and target pace over time

Data Storage (Spring Boot backend) to save and retrieve past runs

Responsive Design optimized for mobile use

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React.js, CSS, Recharts (for graphs)

Backend: Spring Boot, RESTful APIs, Maven

APIs: Geolocation API, WebSpeech API
